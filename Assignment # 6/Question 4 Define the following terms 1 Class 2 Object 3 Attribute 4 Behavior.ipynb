    "1. Class : \n",
    "    A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.\n",
    "2. Object :\n",
    "     an object can be a data structure, a variable or a function. It has a memory location allocated. The object is designed as class hierarchies\n",
    "3. Attribute :\n",
    "    An Attribute is a named property of a class. It has a type. It describes the range of values that that property may hold.\n",
    "4. Behavior :     \n",
    "    An example of an object is a car. A car has attributes (e.g., colour, size, weight, fuel capacity, number of passengers, etc.). A car has behaviour represented by its methods (e.g., start engine, turn left/right, accelerate, stop, turn on wipers, etc.)."
